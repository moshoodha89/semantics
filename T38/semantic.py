# NOTE: Cat and monkey have values close to 1.0 maybe because they are both animals;
# NOTE: Banana and Apple also have values close to 1.0 maybe because they are both fruits.
# NOTE: After running the "en_core_web_sm", it returns that the model only uses context-sensitive tensors,
# has no word vector loaded, and would therefore not yield useful similarity judgement.
